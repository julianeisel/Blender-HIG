# User-Centered Design

This page should give guidelines on how to approach the design aspects of
projects, especially bigger ones.

## Introduction

There won't be an in-depth introduction to user-centered design approaches here
- for that there's plenty of material available.

Here are a few core principles:

* Keep the process agile and iterative. Systems should never be developed in a
  "plan -> implement -> design -> test" kind of process.
* Focus on conversations, not documentation.  
  Documentation has two big issues: Creating it takes lots of time and everybody
  will have a different understanding after reading. It's not the fault of bad
  documentation, it's an inherent problem of written language. Conversations
  help finding differences in understanding - encourage them.
* Produce many design fragments, keep it all on a dashboard.
  When designing things, produce personas, user story maps, scribbles,
  wireframes, high-fidelity mockups (do these relatively late in the process!),
  various test results... All these things help you understand what you are
  creating. And they should all be accessible by everyone in a central location.

The following paragraphs will list the main methods and techniques we want to
use, to ensure a user-centered process. Again, there won't be a proper
introduction here. Just guidelines on how we (plan to) use them and which points
to keep in mind.

## Agile Processes

## Personas

* Let's not just talk about "the user", but come up with realistic personas that
  we can use for a more emphatic approach to design.

## User Story Maps

## Interviews

## Usability Tests

* Usability tests test the system, not the user!
* Should be done regularly for big projects (not just at the end).
* Keep them relaxed and informal. They should be helpful, not a burden.
