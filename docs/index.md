# Blender Human Interface Guidelines

!!! attention "Not an Official Site"
    No content on any of the pages here are official. This is just a setup for experimental purposes.

<!-- In the attention header for now. -->
<!--
!!! attention "Work in Progress"
    The Blender Human Interface Guidelines are currently in early development. There is no claim of completeness at all.
-->

The _Blender Human Interface Guidelines_ (HIG) aim to provide a clear path towards understanding Blender's user interaction schemes and how they apply to its variety of workflows.
They should be a practical resource for contributors, including Add-on authors, designers and core developers.

!!! info
    Please respect that the HIG are rather extensive and that we can't reasonably expect contributors to know all of it. If somebody doesn't follow the guidlines, just kindly make them aware of it. Assume good faith.

## Usability

The term usability has special relevance to the UI team. Its ISO definition is as follows:

!!! quote "Usability"
    <small>ISO 9241-11:2018, sec. 3.1.1</small>

    Extend to which a system, product or service can be used by __specified users__ to achieve __specified goals__ with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a __specified context of use__.  

There is an important implication in this: To maximize effectiveness of our usability engineering process, we need a deep understanding of who uses Blender, what for and in which context. Our aim is to build the engineering process around this implication.

??? todo
    Here are the things we should address before sharing the HIG more widely:

    * Initial vision statement.
    * Add more contents to the [Layouts](architecture/layouts.md) page.
    * Add/improve contents on the [General Process](process/index.md) page.
    * Update [[Human_Interface_Guidelines/Sidebar_Tabs|Sidebar Tabs]] for 2.8 changes.
    * Clearly mark which pages are "approved".
    * Make things prettier :) (mostly through pictures).
